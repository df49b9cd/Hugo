# Project TODO

- [x] Evaluate WaitGroup in Primitives.cs against baselines like Task.WhenAll, Parallel.ForEachAsync, and manual continuation chaining to understand scheduling overhead, under both low and high contention with cancellation-heavy workloads.

- [x] Compare RwMutex read/write paths to ReaderWriterLockSlim, SemaphoreSlim + lock, and AsyncReaderWriterLock under mixed read/write ratios to highlight throughput, starvation, and async fairness differences.

- [x] Exercise `PrioritizedChannel<T>` versus plain bounded/unbounded `Channel<T>` by measuring dequeue latency per priority level, backlog fairness, and the cost of priority switching with varied producer/consumer counts.

- [x] Measure Go.SelectAsync against direct Task.WhenAny loops and channel read polling to capture dispatch latency, timeout handling, and cancellation costs when many ChannelCase entries are registered.

- [x] Benchmark channel creation helpers (Go.MakeChannel, prioritized defaults, single-reader/single-writer toggles) to quantify allocation and steady-state throughput impacts of different option combinations.

- [x] Profile `Pool<T>` retrieval/return throughput versus `ConcurrentBag<T>` and `Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool.DefaultObjectPool<T>` under multithreaded loadâ€”track GC pressure, hit rates, and factory invocation counts.

- [x] Test `Once.Do` versus `Lazy<T>`, `LazyInitializer.EnsureInitialized`, and double-checked locking to document one-off initialization cost and contention behavior.

- [x] Analyze `Result<T>` functional combinators (e.g., `Then`, `Map`, `Ensure`, async variants) in pipeline-heavy scenarios compared to exception-driven control flow and language-integrated pattern matching; include allocations and branch prediction metrics.

- [x] Investigate locker quick paths: benchmark `Mutex.EnterScope` vs `lock`/`Monitor.Enter` for synchronous access, and add contention stress tests contrasting `Mutex.LockAsync` with `SemaphoreSlim.WaitAsync`.
